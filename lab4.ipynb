    "\n",
    "In this lab you will be working on an open-ended mini-project, where you will put all the different things you have learned so far in 571 and 573 together to solve an interesting problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes and tips when you work on this mini-project: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips\n",
    "1. Since this mini-project is open-ended there might be some situations where you'll have to use your own judgment and make your own decisions (as you would be doing when you work as a data scientist). Make sure you explain your decisions whenever necessary. \n",
    "2. **Do not include everything you ever tried in your submission** -- it's fine just to have your final code. That said, your code should be reproducible and well-documented. For example, if you chose your hyperparameters based on some hyperparameter optimization experiment, you should leave in the code for that experiment so that someone else could re-run it and obtain the same hyperparameters, rather than mysteriously just setting the hyperparameters to some (carefully chosen) values in your code. \n",
    "3. If you realize that you are repeating a lot of code try to organize it in functions. Clear presentation of your code, experiments, and results is the key to be successful in this lab. You may use code from lecture notes or previous lab solutions with appropriate attributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assessment\n",
    "We don't have some secret target score that you need to achieve to get a good grade. **You'll be assessed on demonstration of mastery of course topics, clear presentation, and the quality of your analysis and results.** For example, if you just have a bunch of code and no text or figures, that's not good. If you instead do a bunch of sane things and you have clearly motivated your choices, but still get lower model performance than your friend, don't sweat it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A final note\n",
    "Finally, the style of this \"project\" question is different from other assignments. It'll be up to you to decide when you're \"done\" -- in fact, this is one of the hardest parts of real projects. But please don't spend WAY too much time on this... perhaps \"several hours\" but not \"many hours\" is a good guideline for a high quality submission. Of course if you're having fun you're welcome to spend as much time as you want! But, if so, try not to do it out of perfectionism or getting the best possible grade. Do it because you're learning and enjoying it. Students from the past cohorts have found such kind of labs useful and fun and we hope you enjoy it as well. "

For this problem, you will use [Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset). In this data set, there are 30,000 examples and 24 features, and the goal is to estimate whether a person will default (fail to pay) their credit card bills; this column is labeled \"default.payment.next.month\" in the data. The rest of the columns can be used as features. You may take some ideas and compare your results with [the associated research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417407006719), which is available through [the UBC library](https://www.library.ubc.ca/). \n",

Airbnb could use this sort of model to predict how popular future listings might be before they are posted, perhaps to help guide hosts create more appealing listings.

    "#### Problem statement:\n",
    "This project focuses on analyzing the **New York City Airbnb listings from 2019** dataset to predict the popularity of a listing. We aim to identify how factors such as location, property attributes, time of year, and host activity influence a listing's success. The goal is to help hosts better navigate the business by equipping them with a valuable tool to optimize their listings and attract potential renters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data:\n",
    "The data contains 9 explanatory features and one target feature `reviews_per_month`, which will be used as a metric for a listing's popularity. Some observations for `reviews_per_month` are missing; however, those are linked to `number_of_reviews` having values of 0 and can be imputed. <br><br>\n",
    "Listing popularity is likely to be dependent on the location, availability throughout the year, any restrictions (e.g. minimum nights, price) and properties of a listing (e.g. room type). Features that are less likely to contribute to the prediction model's learning are: `id`, `host_id` and `host_name` as these are unique and likely will not provide meaninglful patterns nor contribute to the model's good generalization. The `name` feature is also unique; however, there could be potentially useful features extracted from it, and will be explored in this project. <br><br>\n",
    "Geographical features such as `neighbourhood_group`, `neighbourhood`, `lattitude` and `longtitude` should be examined for any high correlations, as these features may contribute the same amount of information to the model.<br><br>\n",
    "Date feature `last_review` could be used to analyze seasonal patterns in the listing's popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Models:\n",
    "For this problem, we will explore Ridge Regression, Random Forest, LGBM, and Elastic Net regression models. By evaluating these models, we aim to balance interpretability, predictive performance, and computational efficiency.\n"

    "Permutation importance evaluates the significance of a feature by measuring the impact on model performance when its values are randomly shuffled. If shuffling a feature significantly reduces the model's accuracy, it indicates high importance. Conversely, minimal change suggests low importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our **LGBM** model, the features with the highest permutation importance are:\n",
    "- `number_of_reviews`\n",
    "- `month_of_last_review_July`\n",
    "- `month_of_last_review_June`\n",
    "- `minimum_nights`\n",
    "- `availability_365`\n",
    "- `calculated_host_listings_count`\n",
    "- `latitude` and `longitude`\n",
    "\n",
    "These results align intuitively. Location, listing availability, and the duration of a guest's stay likely influence their experience and review. The prominence of June and July also makes sense, as summer months typically see higher Airbnb activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it’s important to note that permutation importance reflects the model's internal understanding of features and may not directly represent their real-world causal relationships."

    "Overall, out of the four models explored, LGBM demonstrated the best $R^2$ scores both before and after hyperparameter optimization, while also showing the least amount of overfitting. Our final LGBM model, with parameters (n_estimators=200, max_depth=10, learning_rate=0.1), achieved an $R^2$ of 0.6268 on the test data. While this is not a perfect score, it is quite adequate for predicting the target. The small gap between the train and test scores further indicates that the model generalizes well. <br>\n",

    "1. Evaluate other ensemble models such as XGBoost and CatBoost, which may have better handling of categorical features or more robust regularization.\n",
    "2. Engineer more features\n",
    "-  From the SHAP test, we observe that `latitude` was assigned some importance, suggesting that geographical location does influence the listing's popularity. Although the `neighbourhood` feature was excluded due to the many unique values, exploring other possible groupings based on latitude (e.g., dividing regions into categories or clustering listings by proximity) could help capture additional patterns.\n",
