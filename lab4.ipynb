    "\n",
    "In this lab you will be working on an open-ended mini-project, where you will put all the different things you have learned so far in 571 and 573 together to solve an interesting problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes and tips when you work on this mini-project: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips\n",
    "1. Since this mini-project is open-ended there might be some situations where you'll have to use your own judgment and make your own decisions (as you would be doing when you work as a data scientist). Make sure you explain your decisions whenever necessary. \n",
    "2. **Do not include everything you ever tried in your submission** -- it's fine just to have your final code. That said, your code should be reproducible and well-documented. For example, if you chose your hyperparameters based on some hyperparameter optimization experiment, you should leave in the code for that experiment so that someone else could re-run it and obtain the same hyperparameters, rather than mysteriously just setting the hyperparameters to some (carefully chosen) values in your code. \n",
    "3. If you realize that you are repeating a lot of code try to organize it in functions. Clear presentation of your code, experiments, and results is the key to be successful in this lab. You may use code from lecture notes or previous lab solutions with appropriate attributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assessment\n",
    "We don't have some secret target score that you need to achieve to get a good grade. **You'll be assessed on demonstration of mastery of course topics, clear presentation, and the quality of your analysis and results.** For example, if you just have a bunch of code and no text or figures, that's not good. If you instead do a bunch of sane things and you have clearly motivated your choices, but still get lower model performance than your friend, don't sweat it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A final note\n",
    "Finally, the style of this \"project\" question is different from other assignments. It'll be up to you to decide when you're \"done\" -- in fact, this is one of the hardest parts of real projects. But please don't spend WAY too much time on this... perhaps \"several hours\" but not \"many hours\" is a good guideline for a high quality submission. Of course if you're having fun you're welcome to spend as much time as you want! But, if so, try not to do it out of perfectionism or getting the best possible grade. Do it because you're learning and enjoying it. Students from the past cohorts have found such kind of labs useful and fun and we hope you enjoy it as well. "

For this problem, you will use [Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset). In this data set, there are 30,000 examples and 24 features, and the goal is to estimate whether a person will default (fail to pay) their credit card bills; this column is labeled \"default.payment.next.month\" in the data. The rest of the columns can be used as features. You may take some ideas and compare your results with [the associated research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417407006719), which is available through [the UBC library](https://www.library.ubc.ca/). \n",

Airbnb could use this sort of model to predict how popular future listings might be before they are posted, perhaps to help guide hosts create more appealing listings.

    "#### Problem statement:\n",
    "This project focuses on analyzing the **New York City Airbnb listings from 2019** dataset to predict the popularity of a listing. We aim to identify how factors such as location, property attributes, time of year, and host activity influence the number of reviews for a listing. We're operating under the assumption that the number of reviews is representative of the popularity of an AirBNB listing The goal is to help hosts better navigate their business by equipping them with a valuable tool to optimize their listings, enhancing their appeal to potential renters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data:\n",
    "The data contains 9 explanatory features and one target feature `reviews_per_month`, which will be used as a metric for a listing's popularity. Some observations for `reviews_per_month` were missing; however, this is because they were linked to `number_of_reviews` having values of 0 and therefore can be imputed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Listing popularity is likely to be dependent on the location, availability throughout the year, any restrictions (e.g. minimum nights, price), and properties of a listing (e.g. room type). Features that are less likely to contribute to the prediction model's learning are: `id`, `host_id` and `host_name` as these are unique and likely will not provide meaninglful patterns or contribute to the model's good generalization. The `name` feature (the name of the listing) is also unique; however, there could be potentially useful features extracted from it, and will be explored in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Geographical features such as `neighbourhood_group`, `neighbourhood`, `lattitude` and `longtitude` should be examined for any high correlations, as these features may contribute the same amount of information to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Date feature `last_review` could be used to analyze seasonal patterns in the listing's popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Models:\n",
    "We are addressing the regression problem by exploring Ridge Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM (LGBM), and Elastic Net models. Each of these models brings unique strengths that could contribute to solving the problem effectively. Ridge Regression offers simplicity and interpretability, making it suitable for understanding feature relationships. Random Forest provides robust performance by capturing complex interactions and handling non-linear relationships. LGBM is known for its speed and efficiency on large datasets, with built-in regularization to prevent overfitting. Finally, Elastic Net combines the strengths of L1 and L2 regularization, making it effective for handling correlated features and feature selection. By comparing these models, we aim to leverage their strengths to achieve the best balance of accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency.\n"

    "**SUMMARY STATISTICS (using describe() method)**\n",
    "- Mean `reviews_per_month`: An average of 1.086 reviews per month suggests limited interaction for most listings.\n",
    "- Most features have outliers and widely different ranges (as we will see again in the histograms). As such, using a standard scalar for numeric features would be a good idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "**FEATURE DISTRIBUTION PLOTS**\n",
    "- Numeric features and the target variables have highly skewed distributions. Therefore, a 'median' strategy for imputation (if needed) will be more appropriate than the mean, as it is less affected by outliers. \n",
    "- The features also have very different ranges. As such we will use a standard scalr to resolve thhis issue.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**UNIQUE COUNTS (using nunique() method)**\n",
    "- Unique count is important for categorical features. We see host_id and id are unique and they will be dropped. The neighbourhood column seems to have more than 200 unique values. This will slightly explode our feature count after one hot encoding. We will test our pipelines with both using this feature (with feature selection) and not using this feature. Since we will not be including all of our testing in this report, the final report may not have this feature.\n",

    "**FEATURE-FEATURE CORRELATIONS**\n",
    "- We see high feature-feature correlations between host_id and id. We were already dropping both these features due to their uniqueness\n",
    "- We also see a high correlation between the target (`number_of_reviews`) and our feature `reviews_per_month`. This correlation makes intuitive sense and therefore we will not be dropping this feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**MISSING VALUES (using info() method)**\n",
    "- Our `reviews_per_month` or target column had roughly 7000 missing values. But we found out this was due to `number_of_reviews` being zero. As such we were able to 'impute' the target values for all observations. \n",
    "- The `last_review` feature will be used to extract the month of last review. This column has some missing values which should be imputed after feature engineering.\n",
    "- A small few amount of `names` and `host_names` also had missing values\n",
    "\n",
    "**SCORING METRICS**\n",
    "- Since our target distribution is skewed and may have potential outliers, we will use MAE as it is easier to interpret and is less affected by outliers. Additionally, it will provide a better measure of absolute accuracy of the predictions.\n",
    "- We will also use $R^2$ as it provides an interpretable result for assessing goodness of fit."

    "#### LGBM Regressor\n",
    "The LightGBM (LGBM) model achieved a train $R^2$ of 0.74 and a CV $R^2$ of 0.66. This is not a significant deviation, indicating that the model is not that heavily overfitting. Both the train and CV $R^2$ scores are higher than those of Ridge regression, suggesting that LGBM is better at capturing the data patterns and generalizes more effectively than Ridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar trend is observed in the MAE (Mean Absolute Error) scores. The CV and train MAE scores for LGBM are -0.484 (+/- 0.011) and -0.441 (+/- 0.004), respectively, which are significantly lower than those of Ridge. This implies that the LGBM model's predictions deviate, on average, by approximately 0.484 reviews per month—an improvement over Ridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, LGBM's fit time is 0.851, which is higher than Ridge's fit time of 0.685, indicating that LGBM is computationally more expensive. Despite the higher computational cost, LGBM outperforms Ridge in terms of capturing data patterns and providing better predictions, making it a more effective model overall for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random Forest\n",
    "The Random Forest model achieved a train $R^2$ of 0.949 and a test $R^2$ of 0.638. The relatively larger deviation between train and test $R^2$ scores suggests some overfitting, as Random Forest tends to excel in capturing data patterns but may struggle to generalize when compared to RidgeCV, which had train and test $R^2$ scores of 0.518 and 0.519, respectively. However, Random Forest still performs better on the test $R^2$ metric, indicating its ability to capture more complex patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of MAE (Mean Absolute Error), Random Forest significantly outperforms RidgeCV. The test MAE score for Random Forest is -0.486 (+/- 0.010), compared to RidgeCV's -0.622 (+/- 0.007), meaning Random Forest's predictions deviate less, on average, by approximately 0.486 reviews per month. The train MAE for Random Forest is even better at -0.181 (+/- 0.002), showing it fits the training data exceptionally well, though at the cost of potential overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside of Random Forest is its computational expense. It has a fit time of 4.470 seconds, which is significantly higher than RidgeCV's 0.685 . Its score time is also longer at 0.072 compared to RidgeCV's 0.009. This makes Random Forest less efficient for scenarios requiring rapid model training or scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Elastic Net\n",
    "The Elastic Net model achieved train and test $R^2$ scores of 0.518 and 0.521, respectively, which are very similar to those of RidgeCV (train $R^2$: 0.518, test $R^2$: 0.519). This similarity indicates Elastic Net and RidgeCV perform comparably in terms of capturing patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of MAE (Mean Absolute Error), Elastic Net and RidgeCV also show minimal differences. Elastic Net's test MAE is -0.622 (+/- 0.012), almost identical to RidgeCV's -0.622 (+/- 0.007). Similarly, the train MAE for Elastic Net (-0.621 (+/- 0.002)) is nearly the same as RidgeCV's (-0.622 (+/- 0.002)). This indicates that both models predict with the same level of average error on the test and training sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net has a slight computational advantage over RidgeCV. It has a fit time of 0.505 (+/- 0.067), compared to RidgeCV's 0.685 (+/- 0.039). The score time for Elastic Net is also marginally lower at 0.008 (+/- 0.002), compared to RidgeCV's 0.009 (+/- 0.001). This makes Elastic Net slightly more efficient, especially for large-scale applications requiring faster model training.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, out of the four models explored, LGBM demonstrated the best $R^2$\n",
    "scores both before and after hyperparameter optimization, while also showing the least amount of overfitting. Our final LGBM model, with parameters (n_estimators=200, max_depth=10, learning_rate=0.1), achieved an $R^2$ of 0.6268 on the test data. While this is not a perfect score, it is quite adequate for predicting the target. The small gap between the train and test scores further indicates that the model generalizes well.\n",
    "The SHAP test, showed that native feaatures as number_of_reviews, minimum_nights as well as our engineered feature month_of_last_review have the highest feature importances in predicting the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Ideas\n",
    "As seen in our report, the hyperparameter optimization did not yield marginally better results. To potentially see improvements in the scores we could explore the following ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluate other ensemble models such as XGBoost and CatBoost, which may have better handling of categorical features or more robust regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Engineer more and better features. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. From the SHAP test, we observe that latitude was assigned some importance, suggesting that geographical location does influence the listing's popularity. Although the neighbourhood feature was excluded due to the many unique values, exploring other possible groupings based on latitude (e.g., dividing regions into categories or clustering listings by proximity) could help capture additional patterns.\n",

    "Creating the best model to solve a problem is a challenging process.

Often, this requires feature engineering, which depends heavily on domain expertise, trial and error, and significant effort.\n",

To address this, feature selection methods are typically applied to simplify the model while maintaining its predictive power.\n",
